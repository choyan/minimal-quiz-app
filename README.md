# React Tailwind Starter
This packaged is bootstrapped with 
 - Create React App
 - TailwindCSS
 - React Router
 - Axios

 - Yup

# Installation
Follow the simple instruction
```
git clone http://gitlab.makdos.biz/makdos/react-tailwind-starter.git

## Extra Note
Create React App doesn't let you override the PostCSS configuration natively, we also need to install CRACO to be able to configure Tailwind. (Note from Tailwind Doc)
